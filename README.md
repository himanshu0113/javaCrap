Java practice programs, including several algorithms and data structures. Contains programs implementing Object Oriented Programming and Design.

This repository will keep getting updated with the java practice programs I will be doing. Many programs in Crap doesn't contain any discription of the requirements. The same will be updated soon.

Corrections and suggestions are welcome.

Keep learning!
